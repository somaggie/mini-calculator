# mini-calculator
 This calculator performs basic operations (+ - * /) on 2 numbers

 I created this as a part of a school project this past semester, Spring 2022. 
 Through this project I learned more about correctly using:
   -how to accept user input and format them using casting
   -basic python data types
   -operators including arthimetic, assignment, logical and comparison operators
   -if... else loops
   -while loops
